## Here I track my weekly work hours. I've been doing it for several years. Usual range is 50-60 hours.

Outlier weeks have 40 or less hours, or 70 and more. I track sit-on-my-ass-and-actually-working hours, not just being in the office. As general schedule, I very rarely take days off, as I genuinely enjoy my days!

(I have one essay topic that's been brewing on me for months called "Great Days, Great Life". In it I'll argue that great life is just a string of great days, and then try to design just one great day. (My current schedule is not far off!) Share soon!)
