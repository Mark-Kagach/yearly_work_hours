## Here I track my weekly work hours. I've been doing it for several years. Usual range is 50-60 hours.

Outlier weeks have 40 or less hours, or 70 and more. I track sit-on-my-ass-and-actually-working hours, not just being in the office. I don't like taking days off, because I genuinely enjoy my days!
