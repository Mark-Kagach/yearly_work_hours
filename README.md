## My weekly work hours over the years (usual range is 50-60 hours).

Outlier weeks have 40 or less hours, or 70 and more. I track sit-on-my-ass-and-actually-working hours, not just being in the office. As general schedule, I very rarely take days off, as I genuinely enjoy my days!

(🚧 Transfering the logs, give me a bit of time*)

(I have one essay topic that's been brewing on me for months called "Great Days, Great Life". In it I'll argue that great life is just a string of great days, and then try to design just one great day. (My current schedule is not far off!) Share soon!)
